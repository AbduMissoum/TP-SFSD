# SFSF: Static and Dynamic File Structures

## **Description**
This project is a practical homework assignment for **Structure de Fichier Statique et Dynamique (SFSF)**. It involves the implementation of various static and dynamic file structures and advanced searching techniques. The main goal is to demonstrate the concepts of file organization, indexing, and efficient data retrieval.

The project includes:
- Implementation of file structures:
  - **Lists** (ordered and unordered)
  - **Tables**
  - **Ordered and Non-Ordered Files**
- Searching techniques:
  - **Primary Key Indexing**
  - **Multiple Property Indexing**

---
## **Features**
- **File Structures**:
  - Ordered and non-ordered lists and tables.
  - Static and dynamic file representations.
- **Search Techniques**:
  - Indexing based on primary keys for fast lookups.
  - Multiple property indexing for advanced queries.
- Efficient data organization and retrieval.
